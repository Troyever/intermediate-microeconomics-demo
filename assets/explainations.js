  // Week 2, Elasticity: Flexible Demand 这个图的解释
  "w2_elasticity_flexible_demand": `
    <p>1. When price decreases, the budget line becomes flatter and demand becomes more price-responsive at some ranges.</p>
    <p>2. Elasticity measures the percentage change in quantity demanded given a one percent change in price.</p>
    <p>3. Around the middle of a linear demand curve, elasticity is often close to -1 (unit elastic).</p>

  // 你后面可以继续加别的图：
  "w2_bc_basic": `
    <p>This graph shows the basic budget constraint with income m and prices p₁, p₂.</p>
    <p>Point A is the original optimum; point B is the new optimum after the price change.</p>
